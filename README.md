# Optimizers-comparision
I used the Fashion-MNIST dataset to develop CNN in my project. I applied sequential, dense, and flattern layers in CNN. In essence, a CNN may be implemented as a Sequential model because it is built up of layers, each of which has exactly one input and output.Each neuron in the simple layer of neurons known as the dense layer receives information from every cell in the layer below it. Based on the results of the convolutional layers, a dense layer is utilised to categorise the images. The input is flattened using flatten. A dense layer can be used as input by flattening the 28x28x50 output of the convolutional layer into a single one-dimensional vector. Additionally, I contrasted the CNN model's accuracy for various optimizers, including Adam, RMS, Adagrad, SGD, and SGDM. Adam scored a great accuracy of 91% out of them.
